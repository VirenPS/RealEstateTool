Using a combination of BS4 (Beautiful Soup) to extract prices of real estate overtime by location and property parameters (sale/rent, flat/semi-detached house/detached house) from Rightmove and appended to a running csv. This data is collated daily by a scheduled cron job, and compiled over time by property.   

## Next steps:
